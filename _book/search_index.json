First Glance of Visual SLAM\n1. What is Visual SLAM?\nUsing cameras to solve the localization and mapping problems.\n2. Classic Visual SLAM Framework\n\nA typical visual SLAM work-flow includes the following steps:\n2.1 Sensor data acquisition\nAcquisition and preprocessing for camera images.  For mobile robot, this will also include the acquisition and synchronization with motor encoders, IMU sensors, etc.\n2.2 Visual Odometry (VO) (Front End)\nEstimate the camera movement between adjacent frames (ego-motion), as well as to generate a rough local map.\n2.3 Back End Filters / Optimization\nThe back end receives camera poses at different time stamps from VO, as well as results from loop closing, and apply optimization to generate a fully optimized trajectory and map.\n2.4 Loop Closing\nDetermine whether the robot has returned to its previous position in order tor reduce the accumulated drift.  If a loop is detected, it will provide information to the back end for further optimization.\n2.5 Reconstruction\nConstruct a task specific map based on the estimated camera trajectory.\n3.

Compared with the original FAST, the main direction of the feature points is calculated\nDescriptor: BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Feature) .  Describe the surrounding image area where the feature points were extracted in the previous step.  ORB has made some improvements to BRIEF, mainly referring to utilizing the previously calculated direction\n\n1. FAST Key points\nFAST is a kind of corner point, which mainly detects the obvious grayscale changes locally, and is known for its fast speed.\n1.1 Main Idea\nIf a pixel is very different from the neighboring pixels (too bright or too dark), then it is more likely to be a corner points. \nCompared with other corner detection algorithms, FAST only needs to compare the brightness of the pixels, which is very fast.\n1.2 Entire Procedure\n\nSelect pixel p in the image assuming its brightness as I_p\nSet a threshold T (for example, 20% of I_p)\n\nTake the pixel p as the center, and select the 16 pixels on a circle with a radius of 3.\n\nIf there are consecutive N points on the selected circle whose brightness is greater than I_p + T or less than I_p - T, then the central pixel p can be considered as a feature point (N usually takes 12, which is FAST-12).\nIterate though the above four steps on each pixel.\n\n1.3 Good\n\nIn the FAST-12 algorithm, to speed up, checking the brightness of the 1, 5, 9, and 13-th pixels on the circle for each pixel can quickly exclude a lot of pixels that are not corner points.  Only when 3 out of 4 pixels are greater than I_p + T or less than I_p - T, may the current pixel be a corner points, otherwise it should be excluded directly.  Such 'pre-processing' operation greatly accelerates FAST corner detection.\n\nNon-maximal suppression:  the original FAST corners are often ”clustered”, meaning a lot of FAST corners present in the same area. Therefore, after the initial detection, non-maximal suppression is required. Only corner points with maximum response in a certain area will be retained to avoid the corners concentrating.\n\n\n\n1.4 Bad\n\nThe calculation of FAST feature points only compares the brightness difference between pixels, thus the speed is very fast, but it suffers from bad repeatability and uneven distribution. \nFAST corner points do not include direction information. \nIt fixed the radius of circle as 3, there is also a scaling problem: a place that looks like a corner from a distance may not be a corner when it comes close. \n\n2. Oriented FAST Key points\nORB adds the description of scale and rotation. The scale invariance is achieved by the image pyramid, and detect corner points on each layer of the pyramid. The rotation of features is realized by the Intensity Centroid method.\n2.1 Image Pyramid\nPyramid is a common approach in computer vision.  The bottom of the pyramid is the original image. For each layer up, the image is scaled with a fixed ratio, so that we have images of different resolutions. The smaller image can be seen as a scene viewed from a distance. In the feature matching\nalgorithm, we can match images on different layers to achieve scale invariance.\n2.2 Intensity Centroid\nIn terms of rotation, we calculate the gray centroid of the image near the feature point.  The so-called centroid refers to the gray value of the image block as the center of weight. The specific steps are as follows\n\nIn a small image block B, define the moment of the image block as\n\n\nm_{pq}=\\sum_{x,y \\in B}x^{p}y^{q}I(x,y), \\quad p, q = \\{0,1\\}.\n\n\nCalculate the centroid of the image block by the moment:\n\n\nC=\\left(\\frac{m_{10}}{m_{00}},\\frac{m_{01}}{m_{00}}\\right).\n\n\nConnect the geometric center O and the centroid C of the image block to get a direction vector \\overrightarrow{OC}, so the direction of the feature point can be defined as\n\n\n\\theta = \\arctan(m_{01}/m_{10}).\n\n3. BRIEF Descriptor\nAfter extracting the Oriented FAST key points, we calculate the descriptor for each point. ORB uses an improved BRIEF descriptor.\n3.1 BRIEF\nBRIEF is a binary descriptor.  Its description vector consists of many 0s and 1s, where 0s and 1s encode the size relationship between two random pixels near the key point (such as p and q): If p is greater than q, then take 1, otherwise take 0. If wetake 128 such p, q pairs, we will finally get a 128-dimensional vector consisting of 0s and 1s.\nGood:\nBRIEF implements the comparison of randomly selected points, which is very fast, and since it expresses in binary, it is also very convenient to store and\nsuitable for real-time image matching.\nBad:\nThe original BRIEF descriptor does not have rotation invariance, so it is easy to get lost when the image is rotated.\n3.2 Improved BRIEF\nThe ORB calculates the direction of the key points in the FAST feature point extraction stage, so the direction information can be used to calculate the ”Steer BRIEF” feature after the rotation, so that the ORB descriptor has better rotation invariance.\n"},"ch7_visual_odometry_part1/Feature_Matching.html":{"url":"ch7_visual_odometry_part1/Feature_Matching.html","title":"Feature Matching","keywords":"","body":"Feature Matching\nFeature matching solves the data association problem in SLAM: determine the current view correspondence between the landmarks (feature points) and the landmarks (feature points) seen before.\n\n1.
