# 3.2 Rotation Vectors and the Euler Angles

## 3.2.1 Rotation Vectors

The matrix representation has at least the following disadvantages:

1. SO(3) has a rotation matrix of 9 quantities, but a 3D rotation only has 3 degrees of freedom.  Therefore the matrix expression is redundant.  Similarity, the transformation matrix expresses a 6-degree-of-freedom transformation with 16 quantities.
2. The rotation matrix itself has constraints: it must be an orthogonal matrix with a determination of 1. The same is true for the transformation matrix.

### Rotation

Can be described by a rotation axis ($$\textbf{n}$$) and a rotation angle ($$\theta$$).

**The conversion from the rotation vector to the rotation matrix:**
$$
\mathbf{R} = \cos \theta \mathbf{I} + \left({ 1 - \cos \theta } \right) \mathbf{n} { \mathbf {n} ^T } + \sin \theta { \mathbf{n}^ \wedge }
$$
**The conversion from the rotation matrix to rotation vector:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{tr} \left( \mathbf{R} \right) &= \cos \theta \mathop{}\!\mathrm{tr}\left( \mathbf{I} \right) + \left( {1 - \cos \theta } \right) \mathop{}\!\mathrm{tr} \left( { \mathbf{n} {\mathbf{n}^T}} \right) + \sin \theta \mathop{}\!\mathrm{tr} ({\mathbf{n}^ \wedge })\\
&= 3\cos \theta  + (1 - \cos \theta )\\
&= 1 + 2\cos \theta .
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore:
$$
\theta = \arccos ( \frac{\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{R}) - 1}{2}  ) .
$$

$$
\mathbf{R} \mathbf{n} = \mathbf{n}.
$$

The axis $ \mathbf{n} $ is the eigenvector corresponding to the matrix $ \mathbf{R}$'s eigenvalue 1. Solving this equation and normalizing it gives the axis of rotation.

## 3.2.2 Euler Angles

One of the most commonly used Euler angles is the yaw-pitch-roll angles. Since it is equivalent to the rotation of the ZYX axis, we take the ZY X Euler angle as an example.

1. Rotate around the $Z$ axis of the object to get the yaw angle $\theta_{\mathrm{yaw}}=y$;
2. Rotate around the $Y$ axis of \textit{after rotation} to get the pitch angle $\theta_{\mathrm{pitch}}=p$;
3. Rotate around the $X$ axis of \textit{after rotation} to get the roll angle $\theta_{\mathrm{roll}}=r$

**A major drawback of Euler Angle is that it encounters the famous Gimbal lock**
