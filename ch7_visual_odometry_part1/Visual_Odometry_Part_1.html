<p>VO <strong>estimates the rough camera movement</strong> based on the information of the consecutive images, and provides a good initial value of the back end.</p>
<p>VO are mainly divided into two categories: <strong>feature point method</strong> and <strong>direct method.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-feature-point-method">1. Feature Point Method</h2>
<h3 id="11-feature-point">1.1 Feature Point</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select some representative feature points from the image.  These points will remain the same after a small change in the camera&apos;s angle of view, so that we can find the same points in each image.</li>
<li>On the basis of these points, the problem of camera pose estimation and the positioning of these points are discussed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Feature</strong> is another digital expression of image information.</p>
<p>In visual odometry, we hope that feature points <strong>remain stable after the camera moves</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="111-corners">1.1.1 Corners</h4>
<p>Therefore, an intuitive way to extract features is to identify <strong>corners</strong> in different images and then determine their correspondence.</p>
<p>Algorithms:</p>
<p>Harris corner, FAST corner, GFTT corner</p>
<h4 id="112-more-stable-local-features">1.1.2 More stable local features</h4>
<p>Simple corner points are variant to scales.  So there are more stable local image features:</p>
<p>SIFT, SURF, ORB</p>
<h4 id="113-feature-point-properties"><strong>1.1.3 Feature Point Properties</strong>:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Repeatability: The same feature can be found in different images.</li>
<li>Distinctiveness: Different features have different expressions.</li>
<li>Efficiency: In the same image, the number of feature points should be far smaller than the number of pixels.</li>
<li>Locality: The feature is only related to a small image area.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="114-a-feature-point-is-composed-of-two-parts">1.1.4 A feature point is composed of two parts:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key-point</strong>: position of the feature point in the image, and some types of feature points also hold information such as orientation and size.</li>
<li><strong>Descriptor</strong>: usually a vector, describing the information of the pixels around the key point according to some handcrafted rules. Features with similar appearance should have similar descriptors.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-orb-feature">2. ORB Feature</h2>
<p>ORB features are composed of two parts: key points and descriptor. </p>
<p>Two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key point</strong>: <strong>Oriented FAST</strong>. Compared with the original FAST, the main direction of the feature points is calculated</li>
<li><strong>Descriptor: BRIEF</strong> (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Feature) .  Describe the surrounding image area where the feature points were extracted in the previous step.  ORB has made some improvements to BRIEF, mainly referring to utilizing the previously calculated direction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="21-fast-key-points">2.1 FAST Key points</h3>
<p>FAST is a kind of corner point, which mainly detects the obvious grayscale changes locally, and is known for its fast speed.</p>
<h4 id="211-main-idea">2.1.1 Main Idea</h4>
<p>If a pixel is very different from the neighboring pixels (too bright or too dark), then it is more likely to be a corner points. </p>
<p>Compared with other corner detection algorithms, FAST only needs to compare the brightness of the pixels, which is very fast.</p>
<h4 id="212-entire-procedure">2.1.2 Entire Procedure</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select pixel <script type="math/tex; ">p</script> in the image assuming its brightness as <script type="math/tex; ">I_p</script></li>
<li><p>Set a threshold <script type="math/tex; ">T</script> (for example, 20% of <script type="math/tex; ">I_p</script>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take the pixel <script type="math/tex; ">p</script> as the center, and select the 16 pixels on a circle with a radius of 3.</p>
</li>
<li>If there are consecutive N points on the selected circle whose brightness is greater than <script type="math/tex; ">I_p + T</script> or less than <script type="math/tex; ">I_p - T</script>, then the central pixel <script type="math/tex; ">p</script> can be considered as a feature point (<script type="math/tex; ">N</script> usually takes 12, which is FAST-12).</li>
<li>Iterate though the above four steps on each pixel.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="213-good">2.1.3 Good</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In the FAST-12 algorithm, to speed up, checking the brightness of the 1, 5, 9, and 13-th pixels on the circle for each pixel can quickly exclude a lot of pixels that are not corner points.  Only when 3 out of 4 pixels are greater than <script type="math/tex; ">I_p + T</script> or less than <script type="math/tex; ">I_p - T</script>, may the current pixel be a corner points, otherwise it should be excluded directly.  Such &apos;pre-processing&apos; operation greatly accelerates FAST corner detection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Non-maximal suppression:  the original FAST corners are often &#x201D;clustered&#x201D;, meaning a lot of FAST corners present in the same area. Therefore, after the initial detection, non-maximal suppression is required. Only corner points with maximum response in a certain area will be retained to avoid the corners concentrating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="asset/fast-corner.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="214-bad">2.1.4 Bad</h4>
<ul>
<li>The calculation of FAST feature points only compares the brightness difference between pixels, thus the speed is very fast, but it suffers from bad repeatability and uneven distribution. </li>
<li>FAST corner points do not include direction information. </li>
<li>It fixed the radius of circle as 3, there is also a scaling problem: a place that looks like a corner from a distance may not be a corner when it comes close. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-oriented-fast-key-points">2.2 Oriented FAST Key points</h3>
<p>ORB adds the description of scale and rotation. The <strong>scale invariance</strong> is achieved by the image pyramid, and detect corner points on each layer of the pyramid. The <strong>rotation</strong> of features is realized by the Intensity Centroid method.</p>
<h4 id="221-image-pyramid">2.2.1 Image Pyramid</h4>
<p>Pyramid is a common approach in computer vision.  The bottom of the pyramid is the original image. For each layer up, the image is scaled with a fixed ratio, so that we have images of different resolutions. The smaller image can be seen as a scene viewed from a distance. In the feature matching
algorithm, we can match images on different layers to achieve scale invariance.</p>
<h4 id="222-intensity-centroid">2.2.2 Intensity Centroid</h4>
<p>In terms of rotation, we calculate the gray centroid of the image near the feature point.  The so-called centroid refers to the gray value of the image block as the center of weight. The specific steps are as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>In a small image block <script type="math/tex; ">B</script>, define the moment of the image block as
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
m_{pq}=\sum_{x,y \in B}x^{p}y^{q}I(x,y), \quad p, q = \{0,1\}.
</script></li>
<li>Calculate the centroid of the image block by the moment:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
   C=\left(\frac{m_{10}}{m_{00}},\frac{m_{01}}{m_{00}}\right).
</script></li>
<li>Connect the geometric center <script type="math/tex; ">O</script> and the centroid <script type="math/tex; ">C</script> of the image block to get a direction vector <script type="math/tex; ">\overrightarrow{OC}</script>, so the direction of the feature point can be defined as
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\theta = \arctan(m_{01}/m_{10}).
</script></li>
</ol>
